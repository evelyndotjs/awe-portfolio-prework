        <h2>Hi there!</h2>
        <p class="intro">
          My name is Evelyn, a Canadian Taiwanese currently based in Barcelona
          with my husband and our 3 year old. I currently work at Amazon and I
          aspire to work in backend development at some point.

          <h3>Why Code?</h3>
          <p class="profile-text">
            I spent almost a decade working in game development & e-commerce so
            I was surrounded by all sorts of programming languages. It was hard not to be
            intrigued but I had no knowledge beyond HTML & CSS from my early days of tinkering Xanga. The 2020 pandemic was chaos but it gave me a window of opportunity to deep dive into coding. In Jan 2021, I officially launched my coding journey by starting with an <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">Udemy bootcamp taught by the excellent Dr. Angela Yu</a>. I highly recommend her course to any web dev beginner!

          <h3>Why AllWomen?</h3>
          <p class="profile-text">
            Having completed 85% of the online bootcamp, I realized I have a
            fondness for backend web development. While it was a truly rewarding
            6 month journey of being a self-taught, I believe there is much to
            gain from being surrounded by like-minded learners and having a
            mentor to review my codes. AllWomen's part time in-person course allows me to have that environment while being able to juggle my full time job at Amazon & motherhood.
