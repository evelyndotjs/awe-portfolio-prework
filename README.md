# Prework for AllWomen Bootcamp (Portfolio)

This is a prework assignment to create a [personal portfolio](https://evelyndotjs.github.io/awe-portfolio-prework "personal portfolio") for the AllWomen Web Dev bootcamp.<br>
In light of keeping the code simple and aligned with the instructions, it is built purely on HTML, CSS, and some Bootstrap.
